# GatorShare

College life is difficult, and expensive (unless you are Bill Gates' child). So, obviously, you'd want to save some money - let's say by sharing that cab ride to the airport (why would you even go there, though?), or maybe buy a large pizza and split the bill (and hopefully the pizza too) with different people. Whatever you want to do, GatorShare has you covered. Find people who want to share or split stuff with you and save money in the process.

## Sprint 1: Frontend
